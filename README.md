# Easy Backup Manager
 
This is a simple program written in python. It manages a list of directories and allows you to make a backup of them to a certain directory with the click of a button. It also has the ability to load any of the archived versions of the directory.

This was a simple project used as an opportunity to learn python and gui development. I accomplished my main goal of making this app with it in its current state and I stopped developing it as there is an app that does what this would do much better. For a useable version of this use ludusavi.
